Given that the mission is currently using about R$ 2K in Uber every single day, I feel like we'd better take a look at what's going on.

The idea of this project is to come up with some coding solution (I thought of using a Jupyter Notebook) to look at, filter, and analyze the use of Ubers by the missionaries of the Brasil Curitiba mission.
